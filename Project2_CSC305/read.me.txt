6. Summary:
After signing into mysql server, four tables are created:
cities - for listing of cities
teams - for listing of teams
games - for listing of games
record - for listing of record for each team (ie.. standings)

When input is read from the console, depending on the character code entered, 
a function is called to handle the input. 
Inside each function switch case statements handle which further function should
be called to generate sql statements which manipulate the tables

When a record or standings are wished to be retrieved, the "record" table is
generated based on the table of games... In this way when a team is deleted, 
the record table will still be returned with accurate results
